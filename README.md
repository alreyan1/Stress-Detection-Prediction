# Stress Level Prediction 🧠📊

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Stress Level Prediction** project focuses on predicting human stress levels using machine learning techniques. It leverages **Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR)** to analyze input features, preprocess data, and evaluate predictive performance. The trained model is preserved using **Pickle** for future deployment and testing.

## 🚀 Features
- Data loading and preprocessing with **Pandas**
- Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**
- Model training using **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- Evaluation with **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Model saving and loading with **Pickle**
